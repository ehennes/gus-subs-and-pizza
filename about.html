      <p>Eating out used to mean stepping into your favorite neighborhood restaurant and being greeted by friendly faces and the rich aroma of food being prepared fresh and wholesome for your enjoyment.</p>
      <p>Prices were affordable for hard-working people and their families. When you left, you were full and satisfied, and were eager to tell your friends and neighbors about your "favorite place to eat."</p>
      <p>We want to bring that back.</p>
      <p>You can once again experience the good old days when you come in for lunch or dinner at Gus's Subs and Pizza.</p>
      <p>Please take a break from the rest of the world... we are glad to have you as our guest. See you here, and come back soon!</p>
      <h4>Thank you</h4>
      <h4>Gus and Linda</h4>
